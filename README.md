## To do
Videos to process
- Bayesan statistics primer + Active Inference (Jeff Beck)
- gradient free learning (coordinate descent)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4praCiy9qU (newest)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9suqiofCiwM
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucqfb33GJJ4 (oldest)
- CREATE: suggested reading order for each topic -> group Jeff Beck series together + Karl Friston + etc.

- Cognitive science: have abstract categories, words/semantics point to those categories - we hope LLMs do the same through text reasoning

- Chirimuuta: ADD proteus greek mythology

- Current AI is good at automation -> RL environments for Excel/etc. -> copies human behaviour but is not creative (can piece together 2 pieces of existing information, but cannot fundamentally invent new science) -> societal impact

- JEPA/I-JEPA -> Y. Le Cun

- Bitter Lesson + OAK + Richard Sutton ("reward is enough" paper with monolithic reward function != active inference where rewards are replaced by an expression of homeostatic equilibrium via the statistics of the markov blanket -> specify the equilibrium we want to achieve instead of maximize reward)
