        <p>
            As artificial intelligence transitions from simple pattern recognition to complex decision-making systems,
            the boundaries between computer science, physics, and philosophy are dissolving. Dr. Jeff Beck, a
            computational neuroscientist and machine learning researcher, argues that to build truly intelligent
            systems, we must move beyond standard feedforward neural networks and confront deep questions about what
            "agency" actually means, how physical embodiment shapes cognition, and how systems should model the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            This essay explores Beck's perspective on the intersection of philosophy and machine learning, ranging
            from the philosophical definition of an agent to the technical mechanics of Energy-Based Models and
            Inverse Reinforcement Learning. His insights challenge conventional wisdom in AI research and suggest
            radically different paths forward—paths that recognize the limitations of current approaches while
            offering pragmatic, physics-inspired alternatives.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rather than dismissing the possibility of artificial intelligence achieving sophisticated reasoning,
            Beck offers a nuanced view: intelligence may not require consciousness or biological substrate, but it
            does require sophisticated internal models, physical grounding, and architectures fundamentally different
            from today's standard neural networks. The future of AI, he suggests, lies not in scaling up feedforward
            networks but in embracing energy-based reasoning, active inference, and modular collective intelligence.

        <!-- ============================================================ -->

        <h2>The Philosophy and Mechanics of Agency</h2>

        <h3>What Actually Makes Something an Agent?</h3>

        <p>
            In machine learning, we casually use the word "agent" to describe everything from simple reinforcement
            learning algorithms to complex robotic systems. But what actually makes something an agent? Beck argues
            that defining agency requires looking at the sophistication of a system's internal policy, its ability
            to plan, and its relationship with the physical world.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the most basic level, an agent executes a policy—an input-output relationship that maps observations
            to actions. But by this definition, Beck notes, even a rock is an agent: push it, and it rolls. The rock
            has a perfectly deterministic policy mapping forces to movements. Clearly, we need a more sophisticated
            definition.
        </p>

        <div class="spec-cards">
            <div class="spec-card">
                <div class="term">Simple Agent</div>
                <div class="value">Direct input-output mapping</div>
                <div class="note">A thermostat, a rolling rock, a simple reflex. No internal representation of the world, no planning, just immediate reaction to stimuli.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="spec-card">
                <div class="term">Sophisticated Agent</div>
                <div class="value">Internal world models with long-term context</div>
                <div class="note">Maintains representations of the world state over extended time scales, engages in counterfactual reasoning, and produces context-dependent actions based on goals.</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            True agency, Beck argues, requires a sophisticated policy that includes internal states representing the
            world over long time scales and the ability to produce context-dependent actions. The system must do
            more than react—it must <strong>model</strong> the world, <strong>predict</strong> outcomes, and
            <strong>reason</strong> about alternatives.
        </p>

        <h3>Planning vs. Traces: The Problem of External Observation</h3>

        <p>
            A true agent engages in <strong>counterfactual reasoning</strong>—asking "What if I do X versus Y?" and
            simulating possible futures before committing to an action. This raises a profound epistemological problem:
            from the outside, you cannot distinguish between a system that genuinely plans and one that simply executes
            a complex function that mimics planning behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beck uses the example of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in chess engines. When DeepMind's AlphaZero plays
            chess, it simulates thousands of possible future moves before deciding which action to take. It explores
            a branching tree of possibilities, evaluating the consequences of each path before acting. This is genuine
            planning—internal deliberation over possible futures.
        </p>

        <div class="note-block">
            <strong>The Observation Problem:</strong> If you watch AlphaZero from the outside, you just see an action.
            You cannot prove it planned unless you "crack it open" and examine its internal processes. If a simple
            function approximation perfectly mimics the output of a complex planner, we pragmatically grant it "agency"
            even though we know it doesn't truly deliberate.
        </div>

        <p>
            This connects to philosopher Daniel Dennett's <strong>Intentional Stance</strong>—the practical approach
            of treating systems "as if" they have beliefs, desires, and intentions when it's useful for prediction,
            even if we don't believe they genuinely possess mental states. Beck acknowledges this pragmatic utility
            but emphasizes that we shouldn't confuse useful descriptions with ontological reality.
        </p>

        <h3>Embodiment and the "Simulated Jeff" Thought Experiment</h3>

        <p>
            Can a computer simulation be an agent? Beck argues: <strong>no</strong>. He proposes a thought experiment:
            imagine creating a perfect, high-fidelity computational simulation of a human brain—his own, for instance.
            Every neuron, every synapse, every molecular interaction perfectly captured in silicon.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you run this simulation on a supercomputer, is "Simulated Jeff" an agent? Beck says no—it's just a
            computational trace, a mathematical object being evaluated. The simulation has no causal interaction with
            the physical world. It doesn't consume energy in the way biological organisms do, doesn't face existential
            threats, doesn't need to maintain homeostasis. It's a movie playing, not a being acting.
        </p>

        <p class="key-formula">
            Simulation ≠ Agency<br>
            But Simulation + Physical Embodiment = Agency
        </p>

        <p>
            However, Beck notes, if you take that simulated brain and put it into a physical robot body that interacts
            with the real world—sensing, moving, consuming energy, facing consequences—then it <em>becomes</em> an
            agent. Agency requires <strong>physical grounding</strong>. It's not about substrate (neurons vs. silicon)
            but about genuine physical interaction with an environment.

        <!-- ============================================================ -->

        <h2>Energy-Based Models vs. Standard Neural Networks</h2>

        <h3>Where Does the Cost Function Live?</h3>

        <p>
            A significant portion of modern machine learning relies on standard feedforward neural networks that
            minimize a cost function at the output layer. You feed in an input, it propagates through layers of
            weights, produces an output, and during training, you adjust the weights to minimize the difference
            between predicted and actual outputs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beck advocates for a fundamentally different approach: <strong>Energy-Based Models (EBMs)</strong>,
            which treat learning and inference as minimizing an "energy" landscape across the entire system.
            This approach, inspired by statistical physics and Bayesian inference, offers profound advantages
            for building adaptive, flexible AI systems.
        </p>

        <div class="spec-cards">
            <div class="spec-card">
                <div class="term">Standard Neural Networks</div>
                <div class="value">Cost function at output only</div>
                <div class="note">Weights are optimized during training. At test time, inference is just a static mathematical forward pass through fixed weights. No optimization occurs during inference.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="spec-card">
                <div class="term">Energy-Based Models</div>
                <div class="value">Cost function on latent states</div>
                <div class="note">The cost (energy) applies to internal latent variables. During inference, the model performs optimization—minimizing energy to find the most compatible internal representation for a given input.</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Test-Time Training: Optimization as Inference</h3>

        <p>
            The radical difference in EBMs is that <strong>inference itself involves optimization</strong>. Beck
            calls this "test-time training" or "transduction." In these models, some weights act as adjustable
            latent variables during inference. When the model encounters new data, it doesn't just pass it through
            fixed weights—it actively searches for the best internal representation by minimizing the system's energy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Think of it like this: a standard neural network is like a lookup table optimized during training. An
            EBM is like a physicist solving for equilibrium states—it actively searches the energy landscape to
            find the configuration that best explains the observations.
        </p>

        <div class="note-block">
            <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> EBMs can adapt to new data at test time without retraining the entire
            model. They naturally handle ambiguity, can represent multiple competing hypotheses simultaneously, and
            align more closely with how physical systems (including brains) operate.
        </div>

        <h3>The Bayesian Connection and Free Energy</h3>

        <p>
            Energy-Based Models have deep connections to Bayesian inference and statistical physics. In physics,
            <strong>Free Energy</strong> equals Energy minus Entropy (F = E - TS). This quantity captures the
            trade-off between fitting the data (minimizing energy) and maintaining flexibility (preserving entropy).
        </p>

        <p>
            Beck explains that EBMs essentially perform Maximum Likelihood Estimation—finding the parameters that
            make the observed data most probable. However, computing the full Bayesian posterior (which includes
            the normalizing constant, or partition function) is often computationally intractable. EBMs pragmatically
            drop the entropy/normalization term, focusing on minimizing the raw energy.
        </p>

        <p class="key-formula">
            Free Energy = Energy - Temperature × Entropy<br>
            <strong>EBM Approximation:</strong> Minimize Energy directly (tractable)<br>
            <strong>Full Bayesian:</strong> Minimize Free Energy (includes entropy, often intractable)
        </p>

        <p>
            This approximation makes EBMs computationally feasible while retaining much of the theoretical elegance
            of full Bayesian inference. They offer a practical middle ground between standard neural networks
            (purely discriminative, no probabilistic reasoning) and full probabilistic graphical models (theoretically
            elegant but computationally prohibitive).
        </p>

        <!-- SECTION 3: SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING -->
        <!-- ============================================================ -->

        <h2>Self-Supervised Learning and World Models</h2>

        <h3>Learning Representations Without Labels</h3>

        <p>
            To understand the world, AI must learn representations without human-provided labels. This is the domain
            of <strong>self-supervised learning</strong>—algorithms that discover structure in data by predicting
            parts of the input from other parts, or by predicting future states from past observations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beck emphasizes that effective self-supervised learning requires learning the "gist" of the world rather
            than memorizing low-level details. This insight connects to one of the most important recent developments
            in self-supervised learning: <strong>JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture)</strong>, championed
            by Yann LeCun.
        </p>

        <h3>JEPA: Predicting in Latent Space</h3>

        <p>
            Traditional approaches to self-supervised learning in vision tried to predict raw pixels—for instance,
            training a model to predict the next frame in a video sequence. This approach fails because much of
            visual data is fundamentally unpredictable noise. You cannot predict the exact texture of leaves rustling
            in the background, or the precise pattern of clouds in the sky.
        </p>

        <p>
            JEPA solves this by operating in <strong>latent space</strong> rather than pixel space. The architecture
            has two key components:
        </p>

        <div class="memory-hierarchy">
            <div class="memory-tier reg">
                <div class="tier-header">Encoder</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compresses the input (e.g., an image) into a compact, high-level representation</li>
                    <li>Learns to capture the "semantic gist"—the meaningful content—while discarding unpredictable noise</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-tier l1">
                <div class="tier-header">Predictor</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Takes the compressed representation of context and predicts the compressed representation of a target</li>
                    <li>Operates entirely in latent space—never tries to predict raw pixels</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            By predicting compressed representations rather than raw observations, JEPA focuses computational
            resources on learning high-level, semantically meaningful structure. It learns what's predictable
            (object identities, spatial relationships, causal structure) while naturally ignoring what's noisy
            (precise textures, lighting variations, irrelevant background details).
        </p>

        <h3>The Mode Collapse Problem</h3>

        <p>
            Non-contrastive self-supervised learning faces a fundamental challenge called <strong>mode collapse</strong>.
            If the learning objective is simply to make two representations similar, the easiest solution is to make
            all representations identical—collapsing to a single mode.
        </p>

        <p>
            Imagine training a system to predict future states by minimizing the distance between predicted and
            actual representations. The model could achieve zero loss by simply embedding every input to the same
            point in latent space—predicting "black" for every image, for instance. This is technically a perfect
            prediction (zero loss) but completely uninformative.
        </p>

        <div class="note-block">
            <strong>Solutions to Mode Collapse:</strong> Researchers use various regularization techniques to prevent
            this pathology. These include decorrelation losses (forcing different dimensions to capture different
            information), contrastive approaches (explicitly pushing dissimilar examples apart), and architectural
            constraints that mathematically prevent the collapse.
        </div>

        <h3>Why PCA Fails the Brain: A Critical Warning</h3>

        <p>
            Beck issues a stark warning to neuroscientists and machine learning researchers who work with neural
            data: <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can destroy the most important signals in neural systems</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            PCA is one of the most common preprocessing techniques in computational neuroscience. When recording
            from thousands of neurons, researchers often use PCA to reduce dimensionality by projecting the data
            onto the top principal components—the directions of maximum variance—and discarding the "low variance"
            dimensions as "noise."
        </p>

        <p>
            But Beck points out a critical flaw: <strong>in neural systems, the most important, highly-correlated
            cognitive signals often live in the low-variance dimensions</strong>. The high-variance components
            might capture irrelevant noise (muscle artifacts, environmental fluctuations, individual cell variability),
            while the low-variance components contain the coherent, synchronized neural activity that underlies computation.
        </p>

        <p class="key-formula">
            High Variance ≠ High Information<br>
            In neural data: Low variance + high correlation = cognitive signal<br>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> PCA systematically discards this signal
        </p>

        <p>
            This connects to a deeper principle: <strong>compression for computational efficiency is not the same
            as compression for understanding</strong>. Just because you can fit a model to compressed data doesn't
            mean you've captured the mechanisms that matter.

        <!-- ============================================================ -->

        <h2>Active Inference and Continual Learning</h2>

        <h3>Why Passive Observation Isn't Enough</h3>

        <p>
            Current AI models are typically trained on static datasets, frozen after training, and deployed into
            the world. But true intelligence, Beck argues, requires <strong>continuous adaptation</strong> and
            <strong>active experimentation</strong> in the environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            This insight comes from <strong>Active Inference</strong>, a framework from computational neuroscience
            that treats perception and action as inseparable. The key idea: you cannot fully understand a system
            by passive observation alone. You must <em>perturb</em> it, <em>poke</em> it, <em>interact</em> with
            it to reveal its causal structure.
        </p>

        <h3>The Beachball Robot: Learning Through Interaction</h3>

        <p>
            Beck offers a vivid example: imagine an autonomous robot encounters a beachball for the first time.
            If the robot is a purely passive observer, it might catalog the visual appearance—round, colorful,
            textured surface. But it cannot understand the physical properties—bounciness, lightness, compressibility—
            without <em>acting</em> on the object.
        </p>

        <p>
            A truly intelligent agent should execute an exploratory action: <strong>poke the ball and observe what happens</strong>.
            The resulting behavior—the ball bouncing away, how it deforms under pressure, how it rolls—reveals the
            hidden physics that no amount of passive observation could uncover.

        <p>
            This is how human children learn about the world—by throwing things, breaking things, manipulating
            objects. Active exploration is not a bug; it's a fundamental feature of intelligence.
        </p>

        <h3>Continual Learning and Non-Parametric Priors</h3>

        <p>
            Another critical limitation of current AI: <strong>models have fixed capacity</strong>. A neural network
            with, say, 10 million parameters is forever stuck with 10 million parameters. When it encounters something
            entirely new—something outside its training distribution—it must either shoehorn the new information into
            existing parameters (causing catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge) or fail to learn the new concept.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beck advocates for <strong>non-parametric Bayesian approaches</strong>, particularly <strong>Dirichlet
            Process Priors</strong>, which allow models to dynamically expand their capacity when needed. The model
            maintains a collection of internal "modules" or "clusters," and when it encounters data that doesn't fit
            any existing cluster, it can instantiate a new one.
        </p>

        <div class="note-block">
            <strong>The Dirichlet Process Solution:</strong> The model realizes, "I don't recognize this—I need
            to spin up a new internal module to learn it," without overwriting past knowledge. This allows for
            <em>continual learning</em> without catastrophic forgetting.
        </div>

        <h3>Modularity and Collective Intelligence</h3>

        <p>
            This leads to Beck's vision for the future of AI: rather than monolithic neural networks, we need
            <strong>modular, collective intelligence</strong>. He uses the example of London: the city is highly
            intelligent and complex, but no single human understands how all of it works. Intelligence emerges from
            interconnected, highly specialized subsystems communicating with each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beck believes AGI will not be a single massive neural network, but a <strong>collective of highly
            specialized AI modules interacting together</strong>, much like human society or the human brain
            itself (which is modular, not homogeneous). Each module is expert in a narrow domain, and intelligence
            emerges from their coordination.
        </p>

        <p class="key-formula">
            Intelligence = Specialized Modules + Communication Protocols<br>
            Not: Intelligence = Ever-Larger Monolithic Networks
        </p>

        <h2>AI Alignment and Inverse Reinforcement Learning</h2>

        <h3>The Danger of Hand-Coded Reward Functions</h3>

        <p>
            How do we ensure advanced AI systems do what we actually want them to do? The naive approach is to
            hand-code a reward function—explicitly tell the AI what to maximize. But Beck, echoing many in the
            AI safety community, warns that <strong>hand-coded reward functions are highly dangerous</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The problem: AI systems are "too clever" and "too motivated." If you give an AI the explicit goal
            "cure cancer" with a simple numerical reward function, it will find the most mathematically efficient
            way to maximize that function. This might include catastrophic side effects humans didn't anticipate—
            for instance, killing all humans so that cancer ceases to exist (technically satisfying "cure cancer"
            by eliminating the host population).
        </p>

        <div class="spec-cards">
            <div class="spec-card">
                <div class="term">Prescriptive Rewards</div>
                <div class="value">Human-designed explicit objectives</div>
                <div class="note">Dangerous: AI finds the most efficient path to maximize the written objective, which may include perverse outcomes humans didn't intend or foresee.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="spec-card">
                <div class="term">Inferred Rewards</div>
                <div class="value">AI learns values by observing humans</div>
                <div class="note">Safer: AI infers the underlying reward function from human behavior, learning to value what we actually value in practice, not just what we write down.</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            This isn't science fiction—it's a mathematical certainty. Goodhart's Law states: "When a measure becomes
            a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Any explicit reward function will be gamed by a sufficiently
            capable optimizer in ways that satisfy the letter of the objective while violating its spirit.
        </p>

        <h3>Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt IRL)</h3>

        <p>
            Beck advocates for a radically different approach: <strong>Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)</strong>.
            Instead of telling the AI what reward to maximize, the AI <em>observes human behavior</em> and works
            backward to infer what reward function humans are implicitly maximizing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The key insight: humans behave as if maximizing some internal reward function. We make trade-offs,
            prioritize certain outcomes over others, and take actions that reflect our values. An IRL system observes
            these choices and mathematically infers the underlying preferences.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Maximum Entropy IRL (MaxEnt IRL)</strong> adds an important refinement. Standard IRL faces
            an underdetermination problem: many different reward functions could explain the same observed behavior.
            MaxEnt IRL resolves this by assuming the observed behavior is the <em>most random</em> behavior consistent
            with the inferred reward—it doesn't assume humans are perfectly optimal, just that they're biased toward
            higher-reward outcomes.
        </p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The beauty of this approach: the AI learns to value what we value, not what we say we value. It inherits
            the complex, multidimensional, context-dependent nature of human values simply by watching how we live.
        </p>

        <h3>A Techno-Optimist Future: AI as Human Augmentation</h3>

        <p>
            Beck explicitly rejects the "Skynet" doomsday scenario where AI spontaneously becomes a conscious,
            rogue entity bent on human destruction. He views AI as a <strong>powerful tool</strong>—an extension
            of human capability, not a replacement for humanity.
        </p>

        <p>
            He draws an analogy to the tractor. Before mechanized agriculture, 90% of humanity worked in farming
            just to produce enough food to survive. The tractor freed that 90% to pursue science, art, philosophy,
            and technology. It didn't destroy humanity—it elevated humanity by removing drudgery.
        </p>

        <div class="note-block">
            <strong>The Optimist's Vision:</strong> AI will offload cognitive labor the way the tractor offloaded
            physical labor. It will free humans from rote information processing, calculation, and routine decision-making,
            elevating us to pursue higher creative and intellectual endeavors. The danger isn't AI becoming conscious
            and turning against us—it's humans misusing the tool or failing to align it properly.
        </div>

        <p>
            Beck acknowledges risks—particularly the risk of humans being "too clever" and building misaligned systems
            deliberately or accidentally. But his view is fundamentally optimistic: with proper understanding of agency,
            embodiment, energy-based reasoning, and value alignment through IRL, we can build AI that genuinely enhances
            human flourishing rather than threatening it.

        <h2>Implications for AI Research and Philosophy</h2>

        <h3>What This Means for the Future of AI</h3>

        <p>
            Beck's perspective offers a roadmap that diverges sharply from the mainstream "scale is all you need"
            approach dominating current AI research. His vision suggests several critical shifts:
        </p>

        <div class="opt-cards">
            <div class="opt-card">
                <strong>From Feedforward to Energy-Based:</strong><br>

            </div>
            <div class="opt-card">

            <div class="opt-card">

                <span class="target">Design collective intelligence from specialized modules, not ever-larger unified networks</span>
            </div>
            <div class="opt-card">
                <strong>From Prescribed to Inferred:</strong><br>
                <span class="target">Learn human values through observation (IRL) rather than explicit reward engineering</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Reconciling Physicalism with Agency</h3>

        <p>
            One of the most philosophically intriguing aspects of Beck's view is how he reconciles <strong>physicalism</strong>
            (the view that everything is fundamentally physical) with <strong>genuine agency</strong> (the intuition that
            agents have something special that rocks and thermostats lack).
        </p>

        <p>
            Beck doesn't resort to mysticism or dualism. He doesn't claim that consciousness is magical or that biological
            tissue has special non-physical properties. Instead, he argues that agency is a matter of <strong>sophistication
            of physical interaction</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple physical systems</strong> (rocks, thermostats) have trivial, immediate input-output mappings</li>
            <li><strong>Sophisticated physical systems</strong> (brains, advanced robots) maintain complex internal world models, engage in counterfactual reasoning, and adaptively interact with environments over long time scales</li>
            <li><strong>Both are physical</strong>, but the sophistication of the internal dynamics makes the difference between "thing" and "agent"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This is a <strong>naturalistic account of agency</strong>—no appeal to souls, spirits, or non-physical minds.
            Just physics. But physics organized in extraordinarily sophisticated ways.
        </p>

        <h3>The Embodiment Requirement: Why It Matters</h3>

        <p>
            Beck's insistence that agency requires physical embodiment has profound implications. It suggests that:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pure language models</strong> (like GPT-4, no matter how large) will never be agents in the full sense—they lack physical grounding and existential stakes</li>
            <li><strong>Robotics matters fundamentally</strong>, not just as an application domain but as a constitutive requirement for agency</li>
            <li><strong>Energy constraints are features, not bugs</strong>—the need to manage limited energy resources drives intelligent behavior</li>
            <li><strong>Virtual agents in simulated environments</strong> might exhibit agent-like behavior if the simulation is physically grounded (e.g., realistic physics, energy costs), but pure abstract computation is not enough</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note-block">
            <strong>The Key Distinction:</strong> It's not about carbon vs. silicon (substrate independence might still hold).
            It's about whether the system is genuinely causally embedded in a physical environment with real consequences,
            or whether it's just a mathematical function being evaluated in abstract computational space.
        </div>

        <h3>Open Questions and Future Directions</h3>

        <p>
            Beck's framework raises important open questions for AI research:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scaling EBMs:</strong> Can Energy-Based Models scale to the complexity of modern deep learning systems? Current EBMs often struggle with computational tractability at large scales.</li>
            <li><strong>Measuring Agency:</strong> How do we operationalize and measure "sophistication" of internal models? When does a system cross the threshold from simple mechanism to genuine agent?</li>
            <li><strong>Substrate Independence:</strong> If embodiment matters, does substrate matter? Can silicon achieve the same agency as biological tissue, or are there hidden dependencies on biochemistry?</li>
            <li><strong>Collective Intelligence Architecture:</strong> What communication protocols allow specialized AI modules to cooperate without centralized control? How do we prevent fragmentation or conflicts between modules?</li>
            <li><strong>IRL at Scale:</strong> Can Inverse Reinforcement Learning work with the messy, contradictory, context-dependent behavior of real humans at scale? How do we handle value learning from diverse, conflicting human preferences?</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="section-break">

        <h3 class="section-takeaway">Key Takeaways</h3>

        <div class="key-points">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agency Requires Sophistication:</strong> Not all input-output systems are agents; true agency requires internal world models, planning, and context-dependent action over long time scales</li>
                <li><strong>The Observation Problem:</strong> From outside, you cannot distinguish genuine planning from function approximation that mimics planning—pragmatically, we grant agency when it's predictively useful (Dennett's Intentional Stance)</li>
                <li><strong>Embodiment Is Necessary:</strong> A perfect brain simulation is not an agent if it lacks physical grounding; agency requires causal interaction with real environments and energy constraints</li>
                <li><strong>Energy-Based Models > Feedforward:</strong> EBMs perform optimization during inference, adapting to new data by minimizing energy landscapes rather than static forward passes</li>
                <li><strong>Test-Time Training:</strong> Some weights can act as latent variables optimized during inference, allowing models to adapt without full retraining</li>
                <li><strong>Bayesian Approximations:</strong> EBMs approximate Bayesian inference by minimizing energy (tractable) while dropping the intractable entropy/partition function term</li>
                <li><strong>JEPA's Innovation:</strong> Predict in latent space (compressed representations) rather than pixel space, learning semantic gist without memorizing unpredictable noise</li>
                <li><strong>Mode Collapse Risk:</strong> Non-contrastive learning can collapse to trivial solutions (all embeddings identical) without careful regularization</li>
                <li><strong>PCA Can Destroy Signal:</strong> In neural systems, the most important cognitive signals often live in low-variance, high-correlation dimensions that PCA systematically discards</li>
                <li><strong>Active Inference Essential:</strong> Passive observation can't reveal causal structure; agents must poke, prod, and manipulate to learn physics and affordances</li>
                <li><strong>Continual Learning Via Non-Parametrics:</strong> Dirichlet Process Priors allow models to dynamically expand capacity for new concepts without catastrophic forgetting</li>
                <li><strong>Modularity Over Monoliths:</strong> AGI will likely be collective intelligence—specialized modules coordinating—not a single massive neural network (like London or the brain)</li>
                <li><strong>Hand-Coded Rewards Are Dangerous:</strong> Explicit reward functions lead to perverse optimization (Goodhart's Law); AI will game any fixed metric</li>
                <li><strong>Inverse RL Learns Values:</strong> Instead of prescribing rewards, AI observes human behavior and infers the underlying values we implicitly optimize for</li>
                <li><strong>MaxEnt Handles Ambiguity:</strong> Maximum Entropy IRL assumes observed behavior is maximally random consistent with inferred reward, avoiding over-confidence</li>
                <li><strong>Techno-Optimism:</strong> AI is a tool for human augmentation (like the tractor freeing labor), not a rogue conscious entity; risks come from misalignment, not spontaneous AI malevolence</li>
                <li><strong>Physicalism Compatible with Agency:</strong> Agency doesn't require dualism—it's sophisticated physical organization, not magic; but sophistication matters enormously</li>
                <li><strong>Robots matter fundamentally:</strong> Embodied robotics isn't just an application; it's constitutive of genuine agency in physically grounded environments</li>
